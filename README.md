# clinic-voll
## About
Thank to Alura and Oracle to give schollarships. This project was realized in that time and it's about a clinic, how to maintenance users, patients and medics and also made an appointment or cancel it. It was really interesting.

## Usage
To use you have to generate a JWT. To generate you have to send a post request to the [server]/autenticacion/login (server could be http://localhost or https://clinic-voll.onrender.com) and fill the body request with login and contrasenia. Where login is the user and contrasenia es la contraseÃ±a.

After that you can access with that token to any url(/pacientes, /medicos, /usuarios y /consultas). Do not forget the token because it is a useless state api.

## Deployed
Use https://clinic-voll.onrender.com to access to the deployed project.

Some detaild you may know, it is deployes by two server: one for backend an another for database from differents providers, the first is onrender and the other is HelioHost.

## Documentation
You can use the deployed or the local. So:

-> http://locahost:8080/docs or https://clinic-voll.onrender.com/docs to get into JSON documentation.

-> http://localhost:8080/docs-ui or https://clinic-voll.onrender.com/docs-ui to get into user interface documentation.

-> You can also download the clinic-voll.postman_collection.json placed in the root of the project and import in your postman. This has some pre defined examples ready to use.
